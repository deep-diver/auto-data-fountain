When you're compromising, you're not giving up on your own needs. You're simply finding a way to meet those needs in a way that also meets the needs of your partner. It can be helpful to approach compromise as a collaborative process. Instead of trying to find a solution that benefits one person more than the other, try to find a solution that benefits both of you. This may require some creativity and flexibility on both sides, but it's worth it if you want to save your marriage."

This can help you understand their feelings and respond with compassion.\n\n- **Respectful communication:** Avoid using hurtful or accusatory language. Instead, focus on expressing your needs and feelings in a respectful and assertive way.\n\n- **Regular check-ins:** Set aside time each week or month to talk about your relationship. This can help you stay connected and address any issues that may be arising.\n\n- **Couples counseling:** If you're struggling to improve communication on your own, consider seeking the help of a couples counselor.
