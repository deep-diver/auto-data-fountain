In general, sessions typically last for 45-60 minutes and are scheduled on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.

Some of the techniques I commonly use include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based interventions, and solution-focused therapy. CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors, mindfulness-based interventions help clients to cultivate present-moment awareness and acceptance, and solution-focused therapy emphasizes identifying and building on clients' strengths and resources. By integrating these approaches, I aim to provide a comprehensive and individualized approach to counseling that can help clients achieve their goals and improve their overall well-being."

Here are some tips on how you can actively participate:  * **Be open and honest:** Share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences openly and honestly with your counselor. This will help them to understand your situation and provide the best possible support. * **Be engaged:** Actively participate in the counseling sessions by asking questions, sharing your perspectives, and trying out new strategies. * **Do the work:** Counseling is not just about talking. It also involves taking action and making changes in your life. Your counselor can provide guidance and support, but it's up to you to put in the effort to make progress. * **Be patient:** Change takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately. Keep working at it and you will eventually reach your goals."
