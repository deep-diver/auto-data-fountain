We don't talk as much as we used to, and when we do, it's usually about the kids or the bills. I feel like we're just going through the motions, and I'm not sure what to do. We used to have so much fun together, and I miss that. I want to feel close to him again, but I don't know how to get there.

        "assistant": "It's understandable to feel this way after 10 years of marriage. It's important to remember that relationships go through different stages, and it's normal to feel like the spark has died down a bit. However, there are things that you can do to try to rekindle the flame.\n\nFirst, make an effort to communicate more with your husband. Talk about your feelings, your hopes, and your dreams. Share your thoughts and ideas, and really listen to what he has to say. Communication is key in any relationship, but it's especially important in a marriage.\n\nSecond, try to make time for each other. Plan regular date nights, or even just set aside some time each week to spend together without the kids. This will give you a chance to connect with each other and focus on your relationship.\n\nThird, try to find new and exciting things to do together. This could be anything from taking a class to going on a hike to trying a new restaurant. Doing new things together will help you to create new memories and experiences, and it can also help to bring you closer together.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to seek professional help if you're struggling to improve your relationship on your own. A therapist can help you identify the problems in your relationship and develop strategies for resolving them. They can also provide support and guidance as you work through this challenging time."
